## How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute, even without writing code:

### 1. Reporting a Bug üêõ

If you encounter a stability issue or an error, please:

* Check the [existing Issues](https://github.com/theFASTER-UNiTY/SmartLinker/issues) to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported.
* Use the designated **Bug Report** template.
* Be sure to include the following information:
    * **Clear steps to reproduce** the bug.
    * The **application version** and your **operating system**.
    * The **full error message** (if any).

### 2. Suggesting a New Feature ‚ú®

We welcome all suggestions to improve the application!

* Use the **Feature Request** template.
* Clearly explain the **current problem** and the **added value** of the proposed solution.

### 3. Submitting Code Changes (Pull Request - PR) ‚öôÔ∏è

If you wish to submit code (bug fix or new feature), please follow this workflow:

#### Environment Setup

## Style and Conventions

To ensure clean and maintainable code, please follow these rules:


* **Docstrings**: Document new functions and classes using docstrings.
* **Testing**: If you fix a bug, include a regression test if possible.
* **Versioning**: Never increment or modify the `__version__` variable. We manage tags and releases.

Thank you for your interest and support! We look forward to seeing your contributions.
